# Web_scraping
"Technews post" is a web scraping initiative aimed at extracting data from the reputable news delivery site, "Business Today". In response to the current trend of social media platforms emphasizing the creation of concise content, we recognize a need for a platform that provides easily digestible news updates. However, traditional news delivery sites such as "Business Today" typically present lengthy articles, which may not be conducive to the fast-paced nature of social media. Therefore, our platform utilizes web scraping techniques to extract information from "Business Today" and convert it into succinct bullet points, facilitating efficient consumption of news updates for our audience.
